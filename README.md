## Added required functions + some functions that may be useful later into development.
Since JS doesn't support function overloading, removeCard only removes card based on index. Adding removal by specific object would make the code very complex (and it seems like it's not that useful)

## Card.js was just my short implementation for my reference, can be ignored.

## Not final version of the code since I haven't seen our Card.js implementation yet
