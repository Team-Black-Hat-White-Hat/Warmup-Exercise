# What I have done

1. Refactoring the css file, I split the style.css to Layout.css and Style.css so you can change the layout through
the Layout.css and change the style through the Style.css. It can avoid changing some attributes which you
don't want to change.
2. I create to different folders, Layout and Style, because the css file will become huge as the project is processing,
so we may split css files by components in the future.
